- ADA-accessible TigerTransit buses will operate continuously on the perimeter of campus during Reunions.

- Replacing the limited Rover golf-cart service, new trolley service with designated stops will provide rides along Elm Drive to Chapel Circle, from noon-1 a.m. on Thursday, and from 8-1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. (Due to the P-rade, trolley service on Elm Drive will be suspended from approximately 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Saturday.) The trolleys are wheelchair-accessible, air-conditioned and can accommodate up to 38 guests.

- Should you need further curbside assistance, please contact the TigerAccess hotline at 609-258-9401 to arrange van service during Reunions. This is a limited, first come, first served accommodation, and advanced reservations are highly recommended.
