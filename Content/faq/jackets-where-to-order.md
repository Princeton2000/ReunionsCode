- [Right here!](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)
- Make sure you've got the right size with our [sizing guide](/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf). 

Note: orders **MUST** be received by [DECEMBER 13, 2024](/data/OrderMyReunionsJacket.ics).

<!--- If you will not be attending Reunions, email [jacket czar](mailto:p2000jackets@gmail.com) after the planning team has had a chance to recover from the weekend, but before June 5, with the subject line “LATE JACKET ORDER.”-->
