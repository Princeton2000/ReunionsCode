- The class has arranged for a number of rooms at Rider University in Lawrenceville for classmates who are still need for reunions housing.  The available beds are single bedroom dormitory accommodations within a 3-4 room suite with a common suite entrance, shared sitting area and bathroom.  Rider has air conditioning, linen rental is included, and is on the reunions shuttle route.   The pricing is slightly different than Princeton University on-campus pricing, but still much more affordable than hotels.  If interested in Rider housing, please reach out to [p2000.housing@gmail.com](p2000.housing@gmail.com).  Rider beds are available on a first-come first-serve basis through Friday, April 25 only.

- You can also consider local hotels that might still have room block availability from the [hotels list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chWYFV69EQlY-L3wMB8wqE0hravAz8YuFYw_Y0W5qkk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) that we created this past summer.

- Closer to Reunions, the University maintains a list of people looking to swap out hotel rooms.
