- Glad you asked!! You can see our sizing guide [here](/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf). Best to have a tailor take your measurements, but anyone can help!

-…if you're stressed about getting your measurements just so, honestly, if know your blazer size...go with that. It runs true to size. It is a roomier traditional fit for the men's blazer. The measurements on the chart are for a finished blazer, so if you are taking body measurements you will need to account for that in areas like chest and waist.

<!--- If you will not be attending Reunions, email [jacket czar](mailto:p2000jackets@gmail.com) after the planning team has had a chance to recover from the weekend, but before June 5, with the subject line “LATE JACKET ORDER.”-->
