Registration hours are: 
- Thursday, May 22 | **Noon - 11:00 pm** 
- Friday, May 23 | **9:00 am - Midnight** 
- Saturday, May 24 | **9:00 am - 10:00 pm**

When you arrive on campus, Registration for the 25th will be in Whitman Courtyard. If you have been allotted a bed on campus, the housing check in is located at the Dillon Gym tent.

If you have an on-campus housing assignment, but think you'll arrive after registration is closed, you are welcome to add a friend's name to your room assignment so that that person can pick up keys on your behalf. Note, however, that wristbanding will be closed by then as well, so Public Safety will need to let you into the site. You *will* have access to your room, but you'll need to get your wristband in the morning.
