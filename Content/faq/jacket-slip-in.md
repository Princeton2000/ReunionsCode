- We've asked, but we truly don't know if it's possible to produce a late order in time for Reunions. The possibility may open up, but we don’t want to suggest it’s do-able for just a few dollars more, and then have you jacketless at the P-Rade. So get your order in by the deadline.

That said, you will be able to order one after Reunions, only it won't arrive until next Oct/Nov, and that’s no fun.
