- ADA-accessible TigerTransit buses will operate continuously on the perimeter of campus during Reunions.

- Replacing the limited Rover golf-cart service, new trolley service with designated stops will provide rides along Elm Drive to Chapel Circle, from noon-1 a.m. on Thursday, and from 8-1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. (Due to the P-rade, trolley service on Elm Drive will be suspended from approximately 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Saturday.) The trolleys are wheelchair-accessible, air-conditioned and can accommodate up to 38 guests.

- In addition, the Universityâ€™s new fleet of **electric shuttles** will loop the perimeter of campus, including the new Stadium Drive Garage and Lot 20 parking at the bottom of campus.

- A map of TigerTransit campus shuttles and Rover routes will be available closer to Reunions on the [Parking and Transportation page of the Reunions website](https://reunions.princeton.edu/map/).

- During Reunions, you will be able to track hotel shuttles and campus shuttles on the [Tiger Tracker mobile website](http://bit.ly/tiger-tracker)."
