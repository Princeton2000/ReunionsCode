If you will be in need of a golf cart at Reunions, the order form is now live. Golf cart rentals are only available for Reunions attendees with mobility impairments and alumni with a medical condition or permanent disability. (The University reserves the right to ask for a copy of a state-issued HC ID card, HC license plate or HC placard.). Carts may be in short supply, so if you do reserve one please let our transportation chair, Ashley Martabano, know in advance, and we may be able to help find some efficiencies. Once you fill out the form for personal carts, please email Ashley and let her know that you reserved one so we can also keep track of who has ordered and is expecting a cart.
