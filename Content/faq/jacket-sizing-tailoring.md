question: Thinking about tailoring (for future Reunions)?

<!--- If you will not be attending Reunions, email [jacket czar](mailto:p2000jackets@gmail.com) after the planning team has had a chance to recover from the weekend, but before June 5, with the subject line “LATE JACKET ORDER.”-->

**Pro-tip:** If you’re thinking about getting your jacket tailored for future Reunions (you'll get them when you get to Reunions this year), it’s best to pick a size that lines up with your shoulder width, as that’s the hardest thing for a tailor to change. The shoulder width should go across your back from shoulder to shoulder, not from shoulder to the bottom of your collar and then back down.

- In any case, get measured using our sizing guide [here](/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf). Best to have a tailor take your measurements, but anyone can help!
