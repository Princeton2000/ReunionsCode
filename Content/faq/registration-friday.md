If you have registered for Saturday-only and now plan to attend the class dinner, you will need to upgrade your registration to the three-day option. You will be able to do this at the tent prior to dinner or at the dinner at Jadwin on Friday night. We will not be able to accommodate classmates or guests who are not registered with the 25th Reunion Class for the weekend at our class dinner. We understand there is a notable cost difference, however we need to be fair to all classmates since a number have registered for the three-day in advance in order to attend the class dinner.
