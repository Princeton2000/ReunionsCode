Reflecting on the timeless ties that bind us, "Bid Every Care Withdraw" is a celebration of the true spirit of Reunions. Drawing on the second line of the classic '00ld Nassau, For all that our class and the world has been through over these last 25 years, Reunions is a chance to put it all aside and reconnect with some of your oldest and dearest friends in the Best Damn Place of All.

Somehow, this perfect lyric from '00ld Nassau has never been used as a reunions theme?
Originally conceived [as a tag line](/images/logos/Logo_2000Reunion_2020_LONG_Color.png) in the art for our 20th by Jena (Sher) Koch, when the committee first came together to consider themes for the 25th, Krista Dobi thoughtâ€¦why not just do that part? We got some great suggestions of other themes, like Roaring 25th, Disc'00, and Once in a Millennium, which we decided we could incorporate under the umbrella of Bidding Every Care Withraw

The theme committee got a ton of great suggestions from our classmates
Did every character withdraw is meant to? It's just a line from old, but it really broke the true spirit of reunions for one weekend a year you can cast decide everything that burdens you would get together with your friends in a spirit togetherness we thought that having Mr. 20th and everything that inspired that brought that about that it made sense for us to have a message of relaxation freedom togetherness the spirit of reunions that is a bit Evercare withdrawal. We are so excited to see you. We're so excited to be together once again, and I can't wait for us to all reunite under the tents the best damn place of all.
