An esteemed American economist and professor, Alan Blinder is widely recognized for his contributions to macroeconomics, policy advocacy and our community. His significant roles include serving as a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and as the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, returning from his term with the Federal Reserve to teach our class ECO 101. Professor Blinder's academic work has had a profound impact on our understanding of monetary policy and financial systems, especially in light of the 2008 financial crisis. We have named him an honorary classmate in recognition of his outstanding achievements in economics, his dedication to public policy, and his commitment to enriching the academic community at Princeton.
