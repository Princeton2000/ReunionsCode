Since joining Princeton in 2015, Rochelle has been an incredible advocate for students and has transformed the Princeton campus â€“ the Meadows Campus, the Frist Health Center, and the Class of 1986 Fitness and Wellness Center among the most visible and immediate examples. She has also worked to change the fabric of the institution, leading efforts to make Princeton both healthier and more welcoming to tigers of all stripes.
