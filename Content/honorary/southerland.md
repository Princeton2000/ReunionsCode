As a toddler, Mibs marched in the P-Rade with the Class of 1926 for their 40th Reunion. She has kept the Reunions fire burning bright in the ensuing years, known across the Princeton community as the Soul of Reunions. Whenever a class is not sure where to go or what to do next, Mibs is there with grace and guidance. For a class that both reaches back and brings forward Princetonâ€™s best traditions, we would be incomplete without Mibs.
