Natalie (Tran) Revelle ’00, deputy director of program-related investments for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brokers agreements that aim to save the lives of millions of children around the world — work that she finds much more rewarding than helping to put together million-dollar deals on Wall Street.
“I did the Wall Street thing, and didn’t enjoy it,” says Revelle, a former consultant with Public Financial Management and McKinsey & Co. “It was a lot of work, and all the hours I put in made me cranky. And there was no sense of accomplishment. After I had kids, I wanted to do something I could be proud of. Working with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to improve global health gives me the opportunity to do something that I hope will make my children happy and proud of me.”
