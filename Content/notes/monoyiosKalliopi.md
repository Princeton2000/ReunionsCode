In honor of the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day this April, Kalliopi Monoyios ’00 is highlighting the ubiquity of plastic in our society. Monoyios, who was named for one of the nine Greek muses, is curating, “The Plasticene,” which opened in January at the Art Students League of Denver. The exhibit showcases 16 contemporary artists who work with plastic.
