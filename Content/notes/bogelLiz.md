ON A TYPICALLY BUSY MONDAY MORNING, Dr. Elizabeth Ryan ’00 sees a long line of patients at the REACH clinic in downtown Ithaca, N.Y. 

Greg, 26, complains of mild chest pain and constipation. Jeffrey needs a tetanus booster and a flu shot but does not want to get them. Amy, who has a thyroid problem, also needs to quit smoking. Joanne, in her mid-40s, is moving out of the state and wants prescriptions filled before she goes. Michael, a weight lifter, reports that he has cut back to smoking only at night. Ryan takes out her stethoscope, listens to his heart, and gives him a high five. (All patients’ names have been changed.)
