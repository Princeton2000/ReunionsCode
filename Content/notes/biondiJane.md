**The book:** When Frank Biondi died in 2019, newspapers reported his decades of significant (and largely unknown) influence on the entertainment world. Now, daughter Jane Biondi Munna has released *Let's Be Frank: A Daughter's Tribute to Her Father, The Media Mogul You've Never Heard Of* (River Grove Books), a book that began in the last years of her father’s life as he battled stage-four cancer. Combining firsthand accounts from Biondi’s life with commentary and interviews compiled by Munna, Let’s Be Frank portrays a man with uncommon kindness, integrity, and character leading an industry where these values are often strained. A shrewd businessman and thoughtful leader, Munna tells us, Biondi is someone we should emulate when navigating the challenges and opportunities that life sends our way.
