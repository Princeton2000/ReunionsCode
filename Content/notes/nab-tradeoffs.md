When 2024's provisional overdose data came out earlier this year showing a 27% drop in deaths from 2023 rates, [Nabarun Dasgupta](https://iprc.unc.edu/iprc-person/nabarun-dasgupta-phd-mph/) felt immense relief.

"I felt like I could exhale for the first time in 20 years," said Dasgupta, a University of North Carolina epidemiologist who studies street drugs. "When we verified [the data] and felt like this [decline] was real, I think I slept better that night than I had in a long, long, long time."
