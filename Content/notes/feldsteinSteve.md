**The book:** The Rise of Digital Repression: How Technology is Reshaping Power, Politics, and Resistance (Oxford University Press) explores how governments are more frequently exerting authoritarian measures via new technologies. Through research conducted in Thailand, the Philippines, and Ethiopia, Feldstein exposes new realities about how governments take advantage of their citizen’s digital habits to slowly constrict their individual freedoms. Feldstein began this book after serving in the U.S. State Department where he oversaw issues of democracy and human rights, mainly in Africa. He first became intrigued by stories of digital repression coming out of China; soon he began looking into this issue in China and around the world. Through on-the-ground research and hundreds of interviews, Feldstein proved his suspicions: this new form of control and manipulation is quietly but rapidly spreading. The Rise of Digital Repression serves as a warning to those around the world who want to protect their democracies and civil liberties … before it’s too late.
