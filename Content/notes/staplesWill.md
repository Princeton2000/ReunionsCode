**The book:** Animals (Blackstone Publishing) uncovers dark truths about the global animal trafficking industry and human exploitation of the natural world. Through following the fictionalized narratives of two men on a shared mission to stop wildlife trafficking, Staples exposes the realities of one of the largest illegal markets in the world. Staples began working on this book with only a vague knowledge of poaching in Africa and Asia, and a desire to understand the underlying forces of corruption and crime driving this massive international industry. Beyond conducting hundreds of interviews with animal activists, former CIA members, and others, Staples ventured to seven countries where he traveled with rangers and even went undercover to do black-market deals. Staples ultimate goal with Animals is to educate readers about the horrors of animal trafficking and the possibility of the extinction of wildlife as we know it. All income from this book will be donated to nonprofits dedicated to protecting wildlife.
