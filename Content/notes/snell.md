When Tristian Snell ’00 first began his investigation into Donald Trump’s Trump University in 2011, the former New York State assistant attorney general didn’t know whether he had a case. Six weeks into speaking with witnesses and examining evidence, and it was clear to Snell that he had a case. A big one.

Snell, who is a lawyer and frequent commentator on MSNBC, NPR, and CNN, went on to successfully prosecute Donald Trump for fraud in 2018, resulting in the former president having to shell out $25 million to his victims and representing his first major legal loss in half a century.
