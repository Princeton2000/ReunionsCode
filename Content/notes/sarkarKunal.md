When Mike Scanlon ’01 moved to California after college to study neuroscience at Stanford, he got in touch with Kunal Sarkar ’00, then living in San Francisco and working at a private-equity firm nearby. The friends got together often and talked about an intriguing area of Scanlon’s studies: how to take advantage of the brain’s plasticity to improve cognitive abilities. In 2005, Sarkar quit his job and Scanlon took a leave of absence from Stanford to create a palette of online games said to help sharpen memory, attention, and other brain functions.
