Reunions runs from Thursday, May 22 - Sunday, May 25, 2025.

<!--**Early registration will run through December 31, 2024.**-->

<!--**Please register early!** The more certainty we have around attendance, the more budget we can commit to making sure you and your guests have a great time.-->

**What's Included:**
- All meals are included in registration.
- All participants will receive a T-shirt, and each classmate will receive a canvas tote bag, bandana, and a commemorative pin.
- Additional swag (fabric, hats, umbrellas, etc.) will be available for purchase at the [class reunions store](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00) through the year.

**Notes:**
- Jackets orders are now closed, but will re-open after Reunions  [here](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00).
- Some swag may not be available for late registrants. 
<!--- Depending on demand, we ***may*** do a follow-on order ***after*** Reunions (you won't look good if you show up) for those who missed out and want their 25th jacket for future Princeton events. These will be significantly more expensive to accommodate a small run and include shipping. **[Order it now.](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)**-->
