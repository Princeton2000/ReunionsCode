**Early registration will run through December 31, 2024.**

**Please register early!** The more certainty we have around attendance, the more budget we can commit to making sure you and your guests have a great time.

**What's Included:**
- All meals are included in registration.
- All participants will receive a T-shirt, and each classmate will receive a canvas tote bag, bandana, and a commemorative pin.
- Additional swag (hats, umbrellas, etc.) will be available for purchase through the year.

**Notes:**
- Jackets are a separate purchase from Reunions Registration. Even if you can't make Reunions, *you **can** still buy a jacket!*
- **Jacket orders MUST be received by December 13, 2024.**
- Jackets can be ordered [here](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00).
- Some swag may not be available for late registrants. 
- Depending on demand, we *may* do a follow-on order *after* Reunions for those who missed out and want their 25th jacket for future Princeton events.
