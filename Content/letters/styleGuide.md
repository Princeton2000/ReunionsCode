A special Saturday morning RED ALERT email! As many people have asked the questionâ€¦you will receive your jacket when you get to campus. The logistics and timing around individual shipping were a little too tight for our comfort. That said, we understand that without your jacket in hand, it can be hard to know what to pack. To that end, the costumes team has put together an incredible [Reunions Style Guide](/jacket)! Think you might need to do a little shopping? Going to the Met Gala on Monday? Weâ€™ve got you covered! Check out the style guide and be ready to work (walk) the runway (P-Rade)!



Actually? Seriouslyâ€¦if you want to wear our class jacket to the Met Gala, I will **absolutely** find a way to make that happen.
