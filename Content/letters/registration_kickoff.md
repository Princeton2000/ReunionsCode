Aughty Aught! _Aughty Aught!_ **Aughty Aught!**

Your Reunions Committee is thrilled to announce that [registration is now open](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/registration/) for Reunions 2025! Head on over to [reunions.princeton2000.org](https://reunions.princeton2000.org) to register, learn more about our theme, "Bid Every Care Withdraw" and check out our amazing class jacket!

**Early Bird Registration**

I want to encourage you to register early if you can. I know we've said this before, but the more certainty we have around attendance, the more we can commit to making sure you and your guests have a great time. For example, entertainment gets booked pretty far out in advance. If it's January and we can only afford some dude with an iPod, even if we get a bunch of money in April, the upgrade options just aren't there. Now, we'll still have a great time, but if you're pretty sure you're coming, commit!

**Class Jacket – [DECEMBER 13](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)**

This is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. With the lead time required to actually manufacture our jackets, we need your order in by **[DECEMBER 13](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)**. That said, you're going to want to run to order this thing anyway! The costumes committee NAILED IT. It's an elegant, timeless design, with several thoughtful details, and, get this, a lightweight fabric that was custom-designed for Reunions. Seriously, [check it out](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/jacket/)! [Get your sizing right](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf) and [get your order in](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00). You're going to look great!

**WhatsApp Group**

We've mentioned this quite a bit, but email deliverability is…not great. Hopefully, you've updated your address in TigerNet, but if you want to make sure you are up-to-date on what's going on with Reunions, [join our WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ENjRGuGdb4iIJI1dBbiRaS). It is not a group chat, and we promise not to spam you…it's just a one-way channel for important announcements to ensure you don't miss anything. That said, please forward this to your friends, and make sure they know how to stay in touch!
