**Sponsorships & Donations**

Hey gang â€“ We've had a couple of people reach out about donations/sponsorships, and I wanted to send out a quick note to clarify. If you're interested in sponsoring an event or making a beverage donation towards an event, we absolutely welcome it! We've got some incredible things planned already, like a smoothie bar and signature cocktails, and while we haven't historically done sponsorships, several classes have recently, and they have really boosted their reunions. Needless to say, we are always happy to find new ways for the 25th blow everyone away.

A few caveats - the donation has to be directly from a person, so we can't have corporate signage (although maybe we could revisit the Nassau 500 theme?). Also, if you want to do a direct donation, e.g. buy wine for a class dinner, we have to help you get a distribution permit for the State of New Jersey. It's a pretty simple process, but just know it's not as simple as shipping cases of wine. In any case, if you're at all interested, please [email Kate Tamalonis](mailto:katetamalonis@gmail.com) directly.

**Personal Golf Cart Rentals**

If you will be in need of a golf cart at Reunions, the [order form is now live](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/golfcart25). Golf cart rentals are only available for Reunions attendees with mobility impairments and alumni with a medical condition or permanent disability. (The University reserves the right to ask for a copy of a state-issued HC ID card, HC license plate or HC placard.). Carts may be in short supply, so if you do reserve one please let our transportation chair, Ashley Martabano, know in advance, and we may be able to help find some efficiencies. Once you fill out the form for personal carts, please [email Ashley](mailto:martabno@alumni.princeton.edu) and let her know that you reserved one so we can also keep track of who has ordered and is expecting a cart.

**Transportation Around Campus**

ADA-accessible TigerTransit buses will operate continuously on the perimeter of campus during Reunions.

Replacing the limited Rover golf-cart service, new trolley service with designated stops will provide rides along Elm Drive to Chapel Circle, from noon-1 a.m. on Thursday, and from 8-1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. (Due to the P-rade, trolley service on Elm Drive will be suspended from approximately 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Saturday.) The trolleys are wheelchair-accessible, air-conditioned and can accommodate up to 38 guests.

Should you need further curbside assistance, please contact the TigerAccess hotline at 609-258-9401 to arrange van service during Reunions. This is a limited, first come, first served accommodation, and advanced reservations are highly recommended.
