Hey team – I could say this is the last warning, but we all know you're getting another notice Friday. With the lead time required to actually manufacture our jackets, we need your order in by **_THIS FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13_**, or **you won't have one for Reunions**. We've had a great response from you all so far, but want to get the message out far and wide, so that you're looking your best at Reunions this year. [Get your order in, ASAP](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00), and check in with your friends to make sure they get theirs ordered as well!
 
 ![Our baller jacket. It's got a custom, lightweight fabric with broad orange and thin black stripes. The interior features our beloved '00s and the lyrics of Old Nassau. We're killing it with this thing.](/images/jacket/P2000_jacket_sketch.png "Class Jacket")
 

**WhatsApp Group**

We've mentioned this quite a bit, but email deliverability is…not great. Hopefully, you've updated your address in TigerNet, but if you want to make sure you are up-to-date on what's going on with Reunions, [join our WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ENjRGuGdb4iIJI1dBbiRaS). It is not a group chat, and we promise not to spam you…it's just a one-way channel for important announcements to ensure you don't miss anything. That said, please forward this to your friends, and make sure they know how to stay in touch!

**Registration Update**

Thrilled to say we're closing in on 700 registrations for our Reunion so far! Over the last couple of days, we've had calls with the beverage, entertainment, and children's committees, and we are going to have some *very* exciting news to share over the next few weeks. If you've registered already, get excited! If you're not…what are you waiting for? [Register now](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000), and we'll see you in May!
