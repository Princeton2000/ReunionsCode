2000! We‚Äôre getting really close to Reunions‚Ä¶36 Days! As we all know, Reunions is more than tents and parades. We‚Äôve got some really stimulating panels and lectures on tap and I wanted to highlight them for you!

**Book Club**

_Join us for two pre-reunions book club sessions highlighting some of the work prepared by our very own classmates!_

**Jane Fleming**, a freelance editor at JFF Books LLC, will lead us in a conversation with **Jeremy Blachman**, a ghostwriter, novelist, and screenwriter who has developed projects with major publishers and television studios, and has also been called ‚Äúa very funny writer‚Äù by the _Wall Street Journal_. Jane and Jeremy will talk about their experiences ghostwriting, as well as Jeremy‚Äôs books, _Anonymous Lawyer_ and _The Curve_ (co-written with Cameron Stracher).
- [April 29, 2025 (9:00 pm ET/ 6:00 pm PT)]()

**Alessandra Lusardi** and her co-authors will talk about their book, _The Lemon_, a satirical novel that follows the aftermath of a celebrity chef's death and the media frenzy that ensues. It's a darkly humorous exploration of foodie culture, fame, and the media. _The Lemon_ was a finalist for the Thurber Prize for American Humor. It was also named one of the most anticipated books of fall 2022 by _Entertainment Weekly_.
- [May 6, 2025 (9:00 pm ET/ 6:00 pm PT)]()

Links to their books, as well as information relating to many other books and music from our classmates, can be found here: [https://reunions.princeton2000.org/library/](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/library/)<br>
So bid every care withdraw this upcoming month and curl up with a good book!<br>

**Alumni Faculty Forums**

_A Reunions tradition for over 65 years, the Alumni-Faculty Forums (AFFs) bring together alumni panelists from the major reunion classes and the Association of Princeton Graduate Alumni for discussions of a broad range of timely or timeless topic. We‚Äôve got several classmates participating as panelists and moderators, be sure to come out!_

**Millennial Lecture Series**

_The Princeton Millennium Project was launched in 1998 by **Mike Bosworth** with **Jen Jennings**. In its initial version, we hosted three lectures reflecting on ‚Äúthe state of society as we approach the next millennium.‚Äù In 2006, our class built on this with the Millennial Lecture Series (MLS), intending to bring discussion of important current issues to the Reunions calendar. The MLS received the Award for Innovation from the Princeton Alumni Council Committee on Reunions in 2011. This year, rather than one lecture, we‚Äôre bringing back three of our most celebrated lecturers (who also happen to be honorary classmates): **[Sean Wilentz](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/honorary/wilentz)**, **[Robert Socolow](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/honorary/socolow)**, and **[Alan Blinder](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/honorary/blinder)**!_

**Upcoming Emails**

Reunions can be a blur, so we're trying to give you as much information as we can so that you can plan ahead and feel like you've made the most of what always feels like too little time. We've got some fun emails to come over the next few weeks, including a **what-to-wear guide** from our Costumes chairs, a **Food & Beverage update** (Did we say **4** signature cocktails, anyone?), and a preview of our entertainment (we're blowing it out, btw)
