Gang – We are less than a month away from the biggest Reunions of All-Time. The Reunions Committee is firing on all cylinders and doing some incredible work…it just keeps getting bigger and better! Make a note of our Pre-Reunions Book Club the next two Tuesday evenings – we thought it'd be a chill way to celebrate our classmates' work and see some familiar faces ahead of the craziness of the tents. Pop in and say hi, and definitely try our recommended pairings!

**In this email:**

- Housing Availability 
- Book Club
- Art Exhibit
- Housing – Great Options Still Available!

**Rider Options**

The class still has room available at Rider College for just $250 for the weekend. I believe we need to give them a final count over the next week or so, and if we have extra rooms, we’re going to offer them to our satellite classes, so please get in touch with housing ASAP at [p2000.housing@gmail.com](p2000.housing@gmail.com). 

**Classmate Rooms**

A few classmates have extra rooms at discounted rates that they no longer need. Two are at Nassau Inn, and two are at Candlewood Suites (on the bus route). To make sure everyone has fair warning, I’m going to post them in our WhatsApp Group all at the same time, tomorrow, Saturday, at 4pm Eastern Time.

**Additional Options**

If you are on Facebook, there is a Group called “[You know you went to Princeton University if…](https://www.facebook.com/groups/229003097142665)” that hosts a housing exchange this time of year. I haven’t seen anything yet, but it’s a good place to look as well.

Also, the University Reunions team maintains a list. If you have an extra room, you can email [reunionshousing@princeton.edu](reunionshousing@princeton.edu) with the details.


**Book Club**

Please join us this Tuesday evening for the first of two sessions of The Class of 2000 Pre-Reunions Book Club! Be sure to get these books and more from our classmates in [The Class of 2000 Library](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/library/).

[Tuesday, April 29, 2025 (9:00 pm ET/ 6:00 pm PT)](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/88601667095?pwd=WBy5HXbjW7iGzjJoRlYsDBP64KKwe5.1)

Jane Fleming Fransson, a freelance editor at JFF Books LLC, will lead us in a conversation with Jeremy Blachman, a ghostwriter, novelist, and screenwriter who has developed projects with major publishers and television studios, and has also been called “a very funny writer” by the Wall Street Journal. Jane and Jeremy will talk about their experiences ghostwriting, as well as Jeremy’s books, Anonymous Lawyer and The Curve (co-written with Cameron Stracher).

_Pairings…_

If you want to have a great book club meeting, you’ve got to have great snacks…we recommend pairing this pre-Reunions session with:

The Ghostwriter: Combine 2 oz. gin, ¾ oz. fresh lemon juice, ½ oz. orange liqueur, and ¼ oz. simple syrup (1:1) in a shaker tin with ice. Shake vigorously until thoroughly chilled, 10–15 seconds, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

Ghost Pepper Candied Bacon: [https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-recipes/pork/sweet-and-spicy-ghost-pepper-candied-bacon/](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-recipes/pork/sweet-and-spicy-ghost-pepper-candied-bacon/)


Save the Date! Next Tuesday, May 6, Alessandra Lusardi and her co-authors will talk about their book, _The Lemon_.

[Tuesday, May 6, 2025 (9:00 pm ET/ 6:00 pm PT)](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87339035683?pwd=tOuUsvk02qgdrcpsATLmRkXq1e7F5W.1) 

**WINNER OF THE THURBER PRIZE FOR AMERICAN HUMOR**, currently in development for TV

Set in the intersecting worlds of fine dining, Hollywood, and the media, a darkly hilarious and ultimately affecting story about the underside of success and fame, and our ongoing complicity in devouring our cultural heroes.

While filming on location in Belfast, Northern Ireland, John Doe, the universally adored host of the culinary travel show Last Call, is found dead in a hotel room in an apparent suicide. As the news of his untimely demise breaks stateside, a group of friends, fixers, hustlers, and opportunists vie to seize control of the narrative: Doe’s chess-master of an agent Nia, ready to call in every favor she is owed to preserve his legacy; down-on-her-luck journalist Katie, who fabricates a story about Doe to save her job at a failing website; and world-famous chef Paolo Cabrini, Doe’s closest friend and confidant, who finds himself entangled with a deranged Belfast hotel worker whose lurid secret might just take them all down.

Animated by the authors' knowledge of high-end restaurants and low-end media, _The Lemon_ delivers a raucous examination of our culture with deliciously cutting prose, crackling dialogue, and an unpredictable plot that will keep you riveted to the last page.

_“[T]his poised and playful debut novel is a sly satire on foodie culture and the modern hype machine. . . . As tart as ‘artisanal citrus,’ as sharp as a chef’s knife, The Lemon is both a gleeful foodie sendup and an incisive takedown of the commercial exploitation of just about everything.”_

—The New York Times Book Review (Editors’ Choice)

Pairings…

We recommend pairing this pre-reunion session with:

Jameson Yuzu Sour: Combine 2 oz. Jameson, 0.5 oz. Yuzu juice, 0.25 oz. honey syrup, and 2 dashes bitters into mixing glass filled with ice. Stir well until chilled and slightly diluted. Strain into a chilled Old Fashioned glass over a large ice cube.

**Art Exhibit**

We are very excited to announce that we’ll be sponsoring an art exhibit over the course of Reunions featuring our very own **Kalliopi Monoyios**! It’s called Mañana Never Comes: Alumni Artists Contemplate the Passing of Time. In addition to Kalliopi, it will feature work by Martha Russo '85, Mark Sheinkman '85, and Jon Levy-Warren '05, and will run from Tuesday the 20th through Sunday at the CoLab Gallery on the 1st floor of the Lewis Center for the Arts.

This exhibit ties together the work of four alumni artists celebrating milestone reunions in a meditation on time. It explores how we can make sense of the passing of time despite being perpetually locked in the present moment. "Live it up, mañana never comes.” 

—Betye Saar

Join us for an artists’ reception on **Friday, May 23rd at 1pm in the CoLab Gallery**!

**Extra Jacket**

One slipped through the cracks! A classmate accidentally ordered a second jacket and it’s up for grabs. It’s a feminine cut size 6. If you or someone you know would want to pick it up, drop me an email!

**WhatsApp Reminder**

I think some people are inadvertently dropping from the WhatsApp group, potentially if you switch to a new device or your phone offloads the app. In any case, you can rejoin no problem [here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmxLL6m77Ae2tKRConATC2). Particularly on Reunions Weekend, more of our communication is going to happen over there, so be sure to join!
