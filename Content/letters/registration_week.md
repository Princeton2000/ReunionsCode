Hello 2000, and welcome to WhatsApp! I am thrilled to announce that thanks to the incredible work of your Reunions Committee, we are ahead of schedule, and started beta testing registration on Thursday! I wanted to give you all a rundown so you know what to expect this week.

We’d love some additional testing from this group, particularly those of you who are international. Don’t worry, even if you don’t know exactly who’s going to be in your group, you can edit your registration later. If you’re interested, we can take 20-30 people tomorrow. Just message me here, and I’ll pass along the link.

Depending on feedback, we’ll open registration to this group on Wednesday or Thursday.

Friday, we’ll send a class-wide email with the theme and jacket design and open up registration.

One very important point is that registration is separate from your class jacket order. Registration runs until May, but with the lead times we need for the jacket, your jacket order must be in by DECEMBER 13. That is very, very soon. The jacket team made an awesome sizing chart that you can find [here:](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/images/jacket/P2000_25th_Jacket_Sizing_Chart.pdf) You can print it out and take it to a tailor or have a friend help. It’s quick, but it does appear to best be done as a two-person job.
