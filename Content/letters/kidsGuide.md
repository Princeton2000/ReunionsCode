**Class of 2000: Record Breakers?**

Hey gang – I’m honestly kind of surprised to say this, but it looks like we are within striking distance of setting an all-time attendance record for the 25th Reunion. With a little under two months to Reunions, we’re at about 600 registered classmates, and almost 1,400 total registered guests. We’re going to have an incredible turnout, and it’s going to be so much fun reconnecting for the first time in a long while.

But we’re not there yet. If you’re on the fence…[register](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000)! If you’re not sure…_get_ sure and [register](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000)! It would be amazing (though not all that surprising) if the Class of 2000 sets the standard for the greatest Reunion of them all.

**Kids’ Guide to Reunions**

When we started Reunions planning two years ago, we heard loud and clear that children can be a significant complicating factor in deciding whether or not to attend Reunions. To help bring down that barrier and get as many of you there as possible, the Committee has been relentlessly focused on making sure that we have a program that is both easy for parents and a blast for kids of all ages. 

[Attached is our Kids’ and Parents’ Guide to Reunions](/kids/). We want to make sure you know what to expect, can make a plan, and get everyone in your party as excited for Reunions as you are…share it with your families and get ready for a party!

**Career Chats**

We have talked a bit about offering “career chats” for our older kids at Reunions. Rather than just listening to us droning on for three days about Princeton, it would be a chance for kids to understand the broad range of things they can do, and how they can start to set those interesting careers in motion. We’re still working it out, but they would likely be quick 20-minute Q&A sessions in one of the open rooms in Whitman over the course of the weekend. If you’re interested in volunteering, we’d love to hear from you! Email me directly to register your interest, we think it will be a refreshing change of pace for our older kids.

**Class Photo**

As you may know, we will take our 25th Reunion photo before the P-Rade at 1pm on Saturday. As you do not know, you can [pre-order that photo](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00) on our [class store](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)! We just opened it up, and we know you’re going to want a record of the best you’ve ever looked (I’m serious, a bunch of people were talking to me about how good you looked).
