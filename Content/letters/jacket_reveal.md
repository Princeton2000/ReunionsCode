Hey team – WHOA. I was about to send this yesterday, but our incredible costumes team told me they had something special…we've got the first pics of our jacket! Read to the bottom and get the first sneak peek!

How can we help you?

As you can imagine, there are a lot of threads coming together over the next couple of months (77 days). I’m planning on sending out a timeline so you know key dates and when to expect to hear from us, but I may not be capturing everything that’s on your mind. We have a [FAQ](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/faq/) page in place, and while we’re keeping it updated, I really want to make sure we’re addressing whatever it will take to get you in particular on campus for Reunions. If anything’s got you on the fence, or if you’re wavering in any way, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. Our class has earned this Reunion, and WE WANT TO SEE YOU there. If you have an idea that might just be cool (should we have an “arrivals board” to coordinate flights/rides?) GET IN TOUCH!

[Annual Giving – March Participation Challenge!](https://agchallenge.princeton.edu)

We just kicked off the March Participation Challenge. Every gift gets a $50 match and we get an extra $10,000 if we have the most gifts of the ’99-’03 cohort. We’re currently in second, 2.5% behind the ‘99s. If that makes you feel the same way it makes me feel…[get your donation in!](https://agchallenge.princeton.edu)

Rider Housing Option

The Housing Committee has done incredible work and has engaged with Rider University for additional affordable options for Reunions. Rider is on the shuttle route, right in Lawrenceville. They’ve offered us two sets of room configurations in their Beckett Village dormitory:

• Double Occupancy Bedroom w/ Bath - $200/bed. 2 single beds in one room with private bath, air-conditioned. (Cost per bed assumes double occupancy. Cost would double for single occupancy in these rooms.)
• Single Occupancy (single bedroom in shared suite) - $250/bed. Single bedroom dormitory accommodations within a 3-4 room suite with a common suite entrance, shared sitting area and bathroom, and air-conditioning.
Prices shown above are for a 3-night stay (Thursday, May 22 - Sunday, May 25) and include a linen rental pack (with pillow, cotton blanket, sheet set, pillowcase, bath towel and washcloth).

Other Reunions are also in touch with Rider, so we’d like to get our rooms reserved ASAP. If you’re interested, please fill out [this google form](https://forms.gle/3dJqY5w1rwGkmwD19) by THIS SUNDAY, March 9: https://forms.gle/3dJqY5w1rwGkmwD19 

Swag

Everyone registered for Reunions will receive a t-shirt, and each party will receive a tote bag, enamel pin, and bandana. But we ALSO have some bonus swag in [our class store](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)! Get belts, extra shirts, umbrellas, hats, and even jacket fabric to make your own accessories (the fabric will be sent to you in time to get things made)…[get it now](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00)!

Tiger Camp Reminder

During Reunions, Princeton partners with the YWCA Princeton to offer “Tiger Camp.” It’s a great, safe, fun place for kids from 3 months to 12 years to spend the day (and maybe give you some breathing room). They offer sessions on Friday from 6pm to midnight, and on Saturday from noon to 6pm and then again from 6pm to midnight. Pricing is set by age, and discounts are available for multiple children. Registration has just opened, but it fills up quickly. You can find more about it here: [https://www.ywcaprinceton.org/tiger-reunion-childcare](https://www.ywcaprinceton.org/tiger-reunion-childcare)
