Hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Tis' the season for deals and steals, so we wanted to remind you of the biggest deal of them all…your Reunions jacket! With the lead time required to actually manufacture our jackets, we need your order in by **_NEXT FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13_**, or **you won't have one for Reunions**. Our jacket is excellent, and we're going to be the best dressed at Reunions for years to come. [Get your order in, ASAP](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/shop/classof00), and check in with your friends to make sure they get theirs ordered as well!

**WhatsApp Group**

We've mentioned this quite a bit, but email deliverability is…not great. Hopefully, you've updated your address in TigerNet, but if you want to make sure you are up-to-date on what's going on with Reunions, [join our WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmxLL6m77Ae2tKRConATC2). It is not a group chat, and we promise not to spam you…it's just a one-way channel for important announcements to ensure you don't miss anything. That said, please forward this to your friends, and make sure they know how to stay in touch!

**Registration Update**

We've got over 550 people registered for our Reunion so far, and that is AWESOME. We're well ahead of pace, and all indications suggest we've got a barn-burner ahead of us. If you've registered already, get excited! If you're not…what are you waiting for? [Register now](https://princeton.reunioniq.com/go/2025/2000), and we'll see you in May!
