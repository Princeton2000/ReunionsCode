**Stand Up for Princeton**

Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Princeton has been in the news recently. The recent threats to Princeton’s funding and academic freedom have had alumni everywhere asking how they can help. To give people the tools to make the case for Princeton and higher education in general, the University has set up a site, [standup.princeton.edu](https://standup.princeton.edu) where you can learn more, and find ways to get involved. Please check it out!

**Entertainment Roundup**

Our class has a few traditions. One of them is having such outstanding entertainment that all of the other Reunions try to come to our tent. We expect that to be the case again this year. It's not something we can help, we are simply that good. [Check out the attached PDF](/pdfs/entertainmentGuide.pdf) and get ready to leave it all on the dance floor!

**Class Service Project**

We are very pleased to announce our partnership with **[Let Her Play](https://www.letherplay.org)**, an organization founded by our very own Gia Fruscione ’00 to increase girls’ sports participation nationwide. In just three years, Let Her Play has partnered with 8 colleges across 41 teams, 15 sports, and over 1,000 student-athlete volunteers. Find out more, including how you can help here: [https://www.letherplay.org/princeton-reunions-2025](https://www.letherplay.org/princeton-reunions-2025)

**Call for Wall Banners**

We had planned on using Princeton 2000 wallbanners as part of our Reunions HQ decorations, but the U-Store is having some supply chain issues and can’t get them to us in time for Reunions. If you have one handy, and are ok loaning it to us for the weekend, send a note to Emily Hicks.

**Peter & The Wolf Reminder**

The Class of 1970 has arranged for a performance of Peter & The Wolf by the American Classical Orchestra for Friday, May 23 at 2:45pm. So far almost 500 people have signed up! While the performance is free, it is ticketed. You can [reserve your spot here](https://tickets.princeton.edu/online/seatSelect.asp?createBO::WSmap=1&BOparam::WSmap::loadBestAvailable::performance_ids=C3A55027-632B-4687-9895-ECD40473F516&BOparam::WSmap::loadBestAvailable::promocode_access_code=25ALUMPW00), and learn more information [here](https://reunions.princeton2000.org/letters/peter_and_the_wolf/).

**Class Yearbook is coming!**

Look out for an email today or tomorrow from “Princeton Class of 2000 - 25th Reunion Yearbook” The University has set up a virtual yearbook for us to help reconnect ahead of Reunions. You’ll be able to make edits and add photos through Reunions, and can search for friends and “nudge” those who haven’t filled it out yet. Kind of a great way to take care of the boilerplate “hi, how are you? where are you?” stuff ahead of Reunions. A few people have pre-seeded their pages to help inspire you. Take a look and give it a go!

**WhatsApp Reminder**

I think some people are inadvertently dropping from the WhatsApp group, potentially if you switch to a new device or your phone offloads the app. In any case, you can rejoin no problem [here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ENjRGuGdb4iIJI1dBbiRaS). Particularly on Reunions Weekend, more of our communication is going to happen over there, so be sure to join!
