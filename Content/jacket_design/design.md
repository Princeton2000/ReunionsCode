# A Reunions Jacket for the Ages

Our costumes committee did an incredible job synthesizing all of the opinions and feedback from the class. We had over 280 responses to our initial survey, and one of things that kept popping up was a desire for a timeless, classic look. And, knowing that we're stuck with this thing for a while, the team wanted to create something that would be not just elegant, but comfortable. 

One of the central ideas to our theme of "Bid Every Care Withdraw" is taking the wisdom and best qualities of those that have come before us and bringing them forward. For our jacket, we did just that. 

As part of the process, the team wound up reaching out to the class of 1972, who we heard had taken an innovative approach to their 50th. Ahead of their 50th Reunion, the '72s came to the conclusion that the heavy jacket they had designed for their 25th was just too uncomfortable for a hot weekend in New Jersey. 

So they changed it. 

The class spent two years working with a team to develop a custom fabric designed specifically for Reunions. We were so impressed by their work that we decided to use it as a starting point for our own jacket. We made our own spin, incorporating a fresh look, with a lining that incorporates our beloved '00s and the lyrics to "'00ld Nassau" We think you're going to love it, for many years to come.

What's more is that we can extend our design in any number of ways. We'll be offering bolts of our jacket fabric for you to do with as you will. Pattern it into a matching dress or pants, make something for your kids, or just keep some around for patchingâ€¦the possibilities are endless.  

A **massive** locomotive to our Costumes Committee for their incredible work: **Mary-Bonner Baker**, **Kate (Blair) Elliott**, **Alex Leigh**, **Katie Oman**, and **Alice (Beha) Teti**!
