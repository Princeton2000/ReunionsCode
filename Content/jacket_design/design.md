# A Reunions Jacket for the Ages

We are pleased to present the design for the Class of 2000’s 25th reunion jacket!  We’ve built on feedback from classmates and reunions chairs, riffed on theme ideas, grappled with the realities of designing business attire for late May’s temperature and humidity, and tried to balance the unique blend of totally extra and profoundly timeless that is Princeton Reunions.

We had over 280 responses to our initial survey, and one of things that kept popping up was a desire for a timeless, classic look. And, knowing that we’re stuck with this thing for a while, the team wanted to create something that would be not just elegant, but comfortable.

We’ve prioritized natural fibers, a lightweight fabric, and classic lines.  We’ve riffed on a custom fabric (with seersucker texture, but not seersucker stripes) that the class of ’72 developed for their 50th, updating it with our own colors to stand out from our adjacent classes and produce a beautiful jacket to wear again and again (or once every 5 years – up to you!).  Our lining fabric features a graphic tribute to “00ld Nassau” and our beloved ‘00s.  

The rest of the costume package is in development, but will include tshirts, a nice tote bag, an enamel pin, and an awesome graphic bananda/scarf/handkerchief.  If you want to get crafty, extra yardage of both the jacket and lining fabrics will be available – a 3-piece orange seersucker suit, perhaps?  A preppy shirt-dress with all the lyrics to Old Nass?  Surprise us. We think you’re going to love it all!

A **massive** locomotive to our Costumes Committee for their incredible work: **Mary-Bonner Baker**, **Kate (Blair) Elliott**, **Alex Leigh**, **Katie Oman**, and **Alice (Beha) Teti**!
